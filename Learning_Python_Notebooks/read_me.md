# Learning Python Notebooks

This folder contains five Jupyter Notebooks to help you get more comfortable working with basic building blocks of python. You will learn about variables, strings, and conditionals in the first notebook. Notebooks 2, 3, and 4 cover lists, tuples, and dictionaries in greater detail. Notebook 5 contains a series of practice problems to help you apply and become more comfortable with using the concepts covered in the earlier notebooks. I recommend completing them in this order. 

Before opening the notebooks, you can download [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator) to your computer. You can then open Anaconda and launch Jupyter Notebooks from the Anaconda dashboard. Make sure that you run all code blocks embedded in the notebooks, and be sure to complete the step-by-step exercises to learn the concepts (coding requires learning by doing and practice, over anything else). Anaconda Navigator or even [Viisual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are the best platforms for more in-depth projects and making sure that your work saves properly.

However, if it is your first time using a Jupyter Notebook, **I highly recommend starting with Google Colab** as this is the easiest, most user-friendly online option. Please note: code may run more slowly on Google Colab than on your computer. 

Steps to open a practice Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab: 
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) in your browser
2. Click on the button called "Open Colab"
3. Click on the button "GitHub" in the "Open Notebook" window
4. Open the [RA Scripts](https://github.com/DANCE-Lab/RA_scripts/tree/main/Learning_Python_Notebooks) GitHub page in your browser
5. Choose the notebook that you want to open in Colab. Copy the URL (Example: [URL for Notbook 1: Learning Python Variables: Strings and Conditionals](https://github.com/DANCE-Lab/RA_scripts/blob/main/Learning_Python_Notebooks/1_Learning_Python_Variables_Strings_and_Conditionals.ipynb))
6. Paste the URL in the Colab bar that says "Enter a GitHub URL"

This should open your notebook! Colab will automatically connect you to Python 3 and you will be able to run notebook code blocks in your browser by clicking the little triangle in the upper left hand corner of the code block (looks like a "play" button). Please reach out to your lab manager if you have any further difficulties running the notebook!


Have Fun!
