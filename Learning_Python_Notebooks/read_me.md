# Learning Python Notebooks

This folder contains five Jupyter Notebooks to help you get more comfortable working with basic building blocks of python. You will learn about variables, strings, and conditionals in the first notebook. Notebooks 2, 3, and 4 cover lists, tuples, and dictionaries in greater detail. Notebook 5 contains a series of practice problems to help you apply and become more comfortable with using the concepts covered in the earlier notebooks. I recommend completing them in this order. 

Before opening the notebooks, I recommend that you download [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator) to your computer. You can then open Anaconda and launch Jupyter Notebooks from the Anaconda dashboard. Make sure that you run all code blocks embedded in the notebooks, and be sure to complete the step-by-step exercises to learn the concepts (coding requires learning by doing and practice, over anything else). 

Have Fun!
